Periodic substitution cipher (sliced like a Vigenere cipher, where each slice is encrypted with a general substitution cipher)
    period = 7
    keys:
        DceOfgiAjklmnpWqrtHuvxbyzS
        tyzuSHArDOWbcevfgiqjklxmnp
        WfgbijkOlmnpqrctuvDxyzeSHA
        glminpqfrtuvxyjzSHeADOkWbc
        imnjpqrgtuvxyzkSHAfDOWlbce
        yADzOWbxcefgijSklmvnpqHrtu

Notes:
- Most of the letters of the keys seem to be in an order of some sort, except for S,H,A,D,O,W.
- Not all characters appear in all slices, so these keys are not unique.
  When a choice was possible, I chose to make all letters except S,H,A,D,O,W in as much order as possible.
- Harry calls the cipher a "keyed Vigenere cipher".
- I looked for a pattern in the keys, but could not find one. If you know how to unify them under one
  overarching rule, please let me know in the "Issues" section of this project.
