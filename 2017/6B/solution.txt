I call this a "periodic affine cipher". Like Vigenere, it is cut into slices, but each
slice undergoes an affine substitution rather than a Caesar shift. All of the affine
substitutions share the same multiplier, but they have different offsets. The offsets
spell a key phrase.

multiplier = 7
key phrase (offsets) = AGRICOLAE MORTEM

(Why is it in the accusative case?)
