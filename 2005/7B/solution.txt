3x3 Hill cipher

decryption matrix:

    C V R      2 21 17
    K E J  =  10  4  9
    R G B     17  6  1

encryption matrix (inverse of the above):

    M F L     12  5 11
    N H C  =  13  7  2
    E D K      4  3 10

Note: I corrected the spelling of "out" to "our" in two places in the plaintext that is in this archive.
