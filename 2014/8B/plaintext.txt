final report 

insertion of the hardware is complete and our tests have concluded there
is no sign from the signal traffic that the security services have any
knowledge of trojan the onshore solar panels are running reliably and
providing more power than needed by the existing server so we are
exploring the possibility of developing a local serverfarm to process data
as it arrives this will also give us additional power if the nsa changes
its encryption scheme the plan to carry power and data to and from shore
via the insulated steel jacket of the cable seems to be working better
than expected the error correcting codes we are using are highly
efficient and the man in the middle server is reliably intercepting around
one in fifteen thousand of the american transmissions across the ba balm
and abstrait we have been harvesting the public keys for analysis and
while it is not immediately clear what information this might provide any
bias in their key generator is potentially exploitable our client in the
middle east seems satisfied with the intelligence it provides and the
additional income provided by key harvesting is funding daily operations
our initial contract to provide a man in the middle attack server to
disrupt us communications remains the highest priority and first forays
have allowed us to intercept communications between the omani and us
governments these carry detailed and useful information about a
forthcoming trade delegation and planned us aircraft movements in the
region we had not expected this level of detail at such an early stage
and would propose downing one of the aircraft as a proof of principle
for potential buyers of our services
