variation on the ADFGVX cipher: block transposition is used instead of columnar transposition
permutation = (0,1,2,5,3,4)
the square (since there are no digits in the plaintext, their placement is irrelevant):
      A D F G V X
    A     i p w a
    D     j q x b
    F s e   r y c
    G t f k   z d
    V o g l u
    X n h m v
keyword = STONE
