# BritishNationalCipherChallenge

This is an unofficial archive of the British National Cipher Challenge
(https://www.cipherchallenge.org/). The purpose is to collect all parts
of the challenges in one place and to preserve them before they are lost
to bitrot and serverrot. The official site only goes back two years, and
archive.org and other sites are also incomplete.

Stuff in this archive is copyright University of Southampton. If they ask
me to, I will have to remove them.

The 2018 challenge is now in session. Answers to it will only be posted
here after they have appeared on the official site.

Some things are missing. We know that. Here is a list of the missing bits.
If you have any of them, please upload in the "issues" section. By "solution"
I mean the cipher and key needed to decrypt; this is distict from having
just the plaintext.

- 2004 part 8B: solution
- 2005 part 6B: solution
- 2005 part 7B: solution and plaintext
- 2005 part 8B: solution and plaintext
- 2005 part 8B: wiring diagrams or photos needed to reconstruct the machine
- 2006 part 7B: solution and plaintext
- 2006 part 8B: solution and plaintext
- 2007 part 8B: solution and plaintext
- 2010 part 8B: photo of the deck of cards
- 2010 part 8B: plaintext
- 2012 part 8B: solution and plaintext
- 2013 part 6B: solution
- 2013 part 7B: solution
- 2013 part 8A: solution
- 2013 part 8B: solution
- 2014 part 8B: solution and plaintext
- 2015 part 8B: the original photo of the deck (we have one after two more cards were added)
- 2016 part 7B: solution
- 2016 part 8B: solution
